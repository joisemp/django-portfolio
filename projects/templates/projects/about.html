                <p>My name is Joise, I am a designer and web developer based in Kerala, India</p>
                <p>I started doing daily UI practices in March 2021, and since then I learned UI design along with Web Devolopment.</p>
                <p>I planned on creating a design every week day until I reach 100 days total, to practice consistency and improve my skills.</p>
                <p>I created this website to be able to share these designs as well as some web template with anybody who is interested in using them as inspiration or research material, and as my porfolio website. I am hoping this project also takes me out of my comfort zone and provides new challenges. I'm planning to get better at development and pick up blogging as well, so lots of exciting things to look out for!</p>
                <p>If you're interested in my journey stay tuned, and if you'd like to get in touch feel free to drop me a <a class="link" href="#">message</a>.</p>
